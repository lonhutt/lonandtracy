              I planned a snowy birthday trip for Tracy in the mountains near Denver, CO. My family had scrambled the previous couple of days to help me get the ring put together and my mom had volunteered to deliver it to me first thing that morning; as a cover she was there to drop off some ski gear of mine since Tracy and I were headed to the mountains. We started off with Tracy and I having breakfast with my mom in Frisco Colorado.<br/><br/>

              After we had arrived and I had a moment to speak with my mom without Tracy around, she informed me that the ring was hidden in my boots, and as a bonus there was a mini bottle of champagne and two cups hidden in my snowboard jacket. After we had finished eating it was off to Copper Mountain to go snow tubing. I had never actually seen the tubing hill in person, but I was planning to propose once we arrived at the top of the run. Once there, however, it turned out to be not only a much smaller hill than I had expected, but it was also extremely warm outside (we were in t-shirts before long). It began to look suspicious for me to wear all of that ski gear, and I also began to strongly reconsider popping the question at that location. Finally after some prodding from Tracy that it was way too warm out for the jacket I was wearing (the one with the ring, champagne, and glasses) I decided to try proposing somewhere else during the day.<br/><br/>

              Once we finished up at the tubing hill it was nearly lunchtime. I suggested we find a gondola that would take us to the top of the mountain and find a lodge up there to get something to eat and drink. It turned out that Copper doesn't have a gondola so we decided to head for Breckenridge that had a gondola (one I had never been on). After a short drive we parked and made our way to the gondola station. I had switched the ring to a much lighter jacket and decided to skip the champagne for now since there was no good way to hide it.<br/><br/>

              As we began to ascend up the mountain I felt assured that we would find a nice out of the way lodge to have lunch, and hopefully a very pretty view where I could ask Tracy to marry me. As it turned out the Breckenridge gondola only goes to the base of the ski resort, with no way to get any higher without a lift ticket. There were probably around 1000 people there trying to get food or get back in the lift lines; this was not the picturesque scene I had imagined for the proposal. With no other choice I again decided to skip this location, and we just had lunch and drinks instead.<br/><br/>

              As the afternoon wore on I was starting to get desperate. I had really wanted to propose in a scenic location and we had no plans for the rest of the trip to be in the mountains. Sometime around 3pm I suggested to Tracy that we should probably head out so we didn't get trapped in the ski rush headed back to Denver that evening (I was more interested in being somewhere nice before sunset). As we drove back to Golden on I-70 I racked my brains for someplace appropriate. Finally I settled on the face of Lookout Mountain near where I went to college. I suggested to Tracy that we take the scenic route back to the hotel, and plan C was in full effect.<br/><br/>

              The sun was just getting ready to set as we began to descend the face of the mountain. As we came around the bend where I knew for sure there was a very good place to park, we were greeted by another car parked right where I wanted to be! Cursing silently I continued driving, trying to figure out what to do next. Very fortunately after just a couple more bends we came upon an even better spot to watch the sunset (and pop questions). Tracy seemed a little surprised as I pulled over and told her come out and look at the view with me. It turned out that the spot I had semi-randomly picked had an excellent view of both Denver and the Front Range, and sunset was just minutes away. With nothing left but fear to stop me I waited until Tracy's back was turned and began to reach for the ring while also starting to go down on one knee. I was about halfway done with both of these operations when Tracy turned back and saw me standing there awkwardly, very obviously pulling something out of my jacket. At this point I decided I was too far down the road to try and recover my composure, so I straightened back up and finished pulling out the ring box as I said to Tracy "I have a question for you". Since you're now looking at our wedding website I imagine you can guess what her answer was. Afterwards we enjoyed both the sunset and champagne now as an engaged couple.<br/>
